# Machine Learning experiments

Hello, world! This effort is directed towards making a compilation of some interesting ML algorithms and datasets to play around, for the community to learn, collaborate and refer whenever required.

In the coming months, I hope to have a variety of ML experiments here.

Feel free to create PRs.
