of the unit to a destination unknown  0 it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under long wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous  1 id like to return it  0 the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems  1 verizon bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple  0 after charging overnight these batteries work great  1 you wont regret it 1 i love this phone  1 a disappointment  0 its not user friendly  0 unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect  0 then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem  0 this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute  0 this pda rocks  1 it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop camera cellphone and excels in those roles  1 i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service  1 pretty piece of junk  0 plug was the wrong size  0 works as described  1 save your

excellent bargain 1 defective crap  0 i would have given no star if i was able  0 i wear glasses and it fits fine with them  1 the sound quality for the device is unacceptable unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing  0 i would not recommend this item to anyone  0 the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad  0 great no problems at all  1 as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens  0 this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching  1 you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not  0 the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too  1 i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well it has protected my handheld perfectly so far  1 very good product well made  1 mobile phone tools are a must have  1 i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone  1 i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source  1 the phone is sturdy and waterproof  1 i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone  0 my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead  1 i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great  1 works great  1 really ugly  0 horrible had to switch 3 times  0 the noise shield is incrediable  1 no real improvement  0 razr battery good buy  1 keep up the good work amazon 1 they refuse to refund or replace  0 unfortunately it easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening  0 so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing  0 great case and price 1 all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked i am not impressed and i am not laughing  0 bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch  1 small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place  1 the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity  1 none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly  0 i am glad i purchased it  1 ive missed numerous calls because of this reason  0 perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this  0 dont buy this product  0 sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone  0 no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid  1 worst software ever used  <\\s> <s> if i could give this zero stars i would  0 trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration  0 the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever  0 i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better  1 i love the camera it really pretty good quality  1 thank you for such great service  1 its a total package  1 the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again  1 i give wirefly 1 star i will contact cingular at&t and inform them of this practice  0 it aggravating 0 great product for the price  1 i have purchased these for both family and friends and

was poorly super glued and slid off  0 please dont waste your money  0 all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase  1 if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it  0 yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design  0 disapointing results  0 cumbersome design  0 great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 great product  1 it a piece of crap 0 my experience was terrible  <\\s> <s> this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 this fixes all the problems  1 worst ever  0 i am very happy 1 ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions  1 i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 the battery life is highly unacceptable  0 that company is a joke  0 it does everything the description said it would  1 due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset  0 it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time  1 verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re set wiping out all my data  0 voice quality signal strength dropped calls  0 it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it not  1 better than expected  1 it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them  0 battery is holding up well  1 also difficult to put on id recommend avoiding this product  0 i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with  0 i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken i went to plug it in and it started smoking  0 sprint terrible customer service  0 linked to my phone without effort  1 they are so cool 1 easy to use  1 better than new  1 what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea  0 piece of trash  0 a pretty good product  1 this is a great phone  1 for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend  1 their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing  1 the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking  0 those phones are working just fine now  1 i am more than happy with this product  1 poor construction  0 this is infuriating  0 overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman  1 sprint charges for this service  0 it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap  0 it fits my ear well and is comfortable on  1 it doesnt work in europe or asia  0 clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent up and coming  1 i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear  1 i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price  1 the worst phone from samsung crap  this crappy samsung e715  is the worst i have ever seeen  0 the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone  0 poor product  0 however i needed some better instructions  0 you need two hands to operate the screen this software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs  0 worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver  1 steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a three pack  0 do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 this is a great product  sure beats using your fingers  1 plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point  0 all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul  1 very dissapointing performance  0 dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone  0 this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand  0 case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear  0 i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones mp3 players in the family  1 dont bother go to the store  0 i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and it a great color 1 i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed  1 you get what you pay for i guess  0 not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection  1 im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there not much reviews about it  1 these are fabulous 1 however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first person shooters since the audio delay messes me up  0 i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone the price of the cable was excellent  1 disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer  0 performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call  0 very wind resistant  1 obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for  0 they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replace easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried  1 i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck  0 linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are  1 great phone  1 when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides  0 im pleased  1 battery is terrible  0 i found the product to be easy to set up and use  1 the earpiece on this is too large or too heavy it keeps falling out of my ear  0 utter crap  <\\s> <s> sound quality is terrible  0 the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work  0 no ear loop needed it tiny and the sound is great  1 finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor  0 the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo reboots overall i still rate this device high  1 talk about useless customer service  0 it felt too light and tinny  0 this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in  0 im happy about this purchase good quality and low price  1 i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones  1 its well designed and very sharp the blue is a very nice color  1 does everything it should and more  1 i could not recommend these more  0 nice sound  1 looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with  1 setup went very smoothly  1 its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it  0 a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design  0 the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off  0 it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip  1 then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping  0 cant upload ringtones from a third party  0 bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked  0 truly awful  0 it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the worn out battery did  1 the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud  1 and none of the tones is acceptable  0 camera color balance is awful  0 this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in it worthless  0 i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 chinese forgeries abound  0 easy to pair with my samsung cell  1 the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used  0 i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well  0 too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service 0 works well  1 the nokia ca 42 usb cable did not work with my phone  0 clear crisp sound  1 i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well  1 the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast  0 the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear  0 do not buy if you want to use the holster  0 the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips  1 it doesnt make you look cool  0 because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all  1 comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day  1 also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player  0 you cant beat the price on these  1 * comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 lightweight and works well  1 so just beware  0 i love this cable it allows me to connect any mini usb device to my pc  1 so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation  0 this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up  1 i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since  0 appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i  1 cant store anything but phone numbers to sim  0 it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phone my wife has the same phone with the same problem  0 poor quality  0 jabra ear gels r the best  1 not worth it  0 the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced  0 it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned  1 unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc  0 it was a great phone  1 if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre  0 good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet  1 my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand  1 this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv <\\s>',"b""Looks great and is strong.\t1\nI have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.\t1\nThe update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.\t0\nDisappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.\t0\nGreat software for Motorolas.\t1\nThe delivery was on time.\t1\nVery easy to use.\t1\nUncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).\t0\nThe volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.\t0\nIt holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.\t1\nI'd like to return it.\t0\nThe keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.\t1\nVerizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.\t0\nAfter charging overnight, these batteries work great.\t1\nYou won't regret it!\t1\nI love this phone!.\t1\nA Disappointment.\t0\nIts not user friendly.\t0\nUnfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.\t0\nThen I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.\t0\nThis results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.\t0\nThis PDA rocks.\t1\nIt is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.\t1\nI would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!\t1\nI had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.\t1\nPretty piece of junk.\t0\nPlug was the wrong size.\t0\nWorks as described.\t1\nSave your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.\t0\nBad Purchase.\t0\nWELL IM SATISFIED.\t1\nThe bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.\t1\nThis battery is an excellent bargain!\t1\nDefective crap.\t0\nI would have given no star if I was able.\t0\nI wear glasses and it fits fine with them.\t1\nThe sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.\t0\nI would not recommend this item to anyone.\t0\nThe holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.\t0\ngreat...no problems at all!.\t1\nAs an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.\t0\nThis frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.\t1\nYou never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.\t0\nThe sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.\t1\nI got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.\t1\nvery good product, well made.\t1\nMobile Phone Tools are a must have.\t1\nI am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.\t1\nI received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.\t1\nThe phone is sturdy and waterproof.\t1\nI am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.\t0\nMy only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)\t0\nThanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!\t1\nI ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.\t1\nI had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.\t1\nWorks great!.\t1\nREALLY UGLY.\t0\nhorrible, had to switch 3 times.\t0\nThe noise shield is incrediable.\t1\nNo real improvement.\t0\nRazr Battery - Good buy.\t1\nKeep up the good work Amazon!!\t1\nThey refuse to refund or replace.\t0\nUnfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.\t0\nSo I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.\t0\nGreat case and price!\t1\nAll it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.\t0\nBluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.\t1\nSmall, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.\t1\nThe eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.\t1\nnone of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.\t0\nI am glad I purchased it.\t1\nI've missed numerous calls because of this reason.\t0\nPerhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.\t0\nDon't buy this product.\t0\nsucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.\t0\nNo shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.\t1\nWorst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.\t0\nTrying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.\t0\nThe case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.\t0\nI own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.\t1\nI love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.\t1\nThank you for such great service.\t1\nIts a total package.\t1\nThe seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.\t1\nI give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.\t0\nIt's AGGRAVATING!\t0\nGreat product for the price!.\t1\nI have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use\t1\nVirgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!\t1\nNone of it works, just don't buy it.\t0\nMuddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.\t0\nPlease dont waste your money.\t0\nAll in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.\t1\nIf you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.\t0\nYet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.\t0\nDisapointing Results.\t0\nCumbersome design.\t0\nGreat it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!\t1\nGreat Product.\t1\nIt's A PIECE OF CRAP!\t0\nMy experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!\t0\nThis fixes all the problems.\t1\nWorst ever.\t0\nI am very happy\t1\nI've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.\t1\nI can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what?\t0\nThe battery life is highly unacceptable.\t0\nThat company is a joke.\t0\nIt does everything the description said it would.\t1\nDue to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.\t0\nIt works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.\t1\nVerizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.\t0\nVoice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.\t0\nIt plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.\t1\nBetter than expected.\t1\nIt feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.\t0\nBattery is holding up well.\t1\nAlso difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.\t0\nI only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.\t0\nI got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.\t0\nSprint - terrible customer service.\t0\nLinked to my phone without effort.\t1\nTHey are so cool!\t1\nEasy to use.\t1\nBetter Than New.\t1\nWhat possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...\t0\nPiece of trash.\t0\nA pretty good product.\t1\nThis is a great phone!.\t1\nFor the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.\t1\nTheir Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.\t1\nThe real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.\t0\nThose phones are working just fine now.\t1\nI am more than happy with this product.\t1\nPoor Construction.\t0\nThis is infuriating.\t0\nOverall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.\t1\nSprint charges for this service.\t0\nIt is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.\t0\nIt fits my ear well and is comfortable on.\t1\nIt doesn't work in Europe or Asia.\t0\nclipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.\t1\nI like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.\t1\nI was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.\t1\nthe worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.\t0\nthe charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.\t0\nPoor product.\t0\nHowever I needed some better instructions.\t0\nYou need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.\t0\nWorked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).\t1\nSteer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.\t0\nDO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS\t0\nThis is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.\t1\nPlus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.\t0\nAll the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.\t1\nVery Dissapointing Performance.\t0\nDon't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.\t0\nThis phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.\t0\nCase was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.\t0\nI recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.\t1\nDon't bother - go to the store.\t0\nI posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!\t1\nI did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.\t1\nYou get what you pay for I guess.\t0\nNot only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.\t1\nim surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.\t1\nThese are fabulous!\t1\nHowever, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.\t0\nI used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.\t1\nDisappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.\t0\nPerformed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.\t0\nVery wind-resistant.\t1\nObviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.\t0\nThey do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.\t1\nI contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.\t0\nLinksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!\t0\nPhone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.\t1\nGreat phone.\t1\nWhen I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.\t0\nI'm pleased.\t1\nBattery is terrible.\t0\nI found the product to be easy to set up and use.\t1\nThe earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.\t0\nUtter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.\t0\nThe charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.\t0\nNo ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.\t1\nFinally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.\t0\nThe handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.\t1\nTalk about USELESS customer service.\t0\nIt felt too light and tinny..\t0\nThis does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.\t0\nI'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.\t1\nI love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.\t1\nIts well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.\t1\nDoes everything it should and more.\t1\nI could not recommend these more.\t0\nNice Sound.\t1\nLooks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!\t0\nMuch less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.\t1\nSetup went very smoothly.\t1\nits extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.\t0\nA must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design.\t0\nThe first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.\t0\nIt is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.\t1\nThen I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.\t0\nCan't upload ringtones from a third party.\t0\nBluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.\t0\nTruly awful.\t0\nIt works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.\t1\nThe volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).\t1\nAnd none of the tones is acceptable.\t0\ncamera color balance is AWFUL.\t0\nThis product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.\t0\nI love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!\t1\nChinese Forgeries Abound!.\t0\nEasy to pair with my Samsung Cell.\t1\nThe instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.\t0\ni would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.\t0\nToo bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!\t0\nWorks well.\t1\nThe nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.\t0\nClear crisp sound.\t1\nI have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.\t1\nThe biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.\t0\nThe design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.\t0\nDo NOT buy if you want to use the holster.\t0\nThe phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.\t1\nIt doesn't make you look cool.\t0\nBecause both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.\t1\nComfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.\t1\nAlso, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.\t0\nYou can't beat the price on these.\t1\n* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!\t1\nlightweight and works well.\t1\nSo just beware.\t0\nI love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.\t1\nSo anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.\t0\nThis is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.\t1\nI bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.\t0\nAppears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.\t1\nCan't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.\t0\nIt lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.\t0\nPoor quality.\t0\njabra ear gels R the best!.\t1\nNot worth it.\t0\nThe phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.\t0\nIt quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.\t1\nUnfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).\t0\nIt was a great phone.\t1\nif you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.\t0\nGood value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.\t1\nMy phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.\t1\nThis is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!\t1\nThink it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!\t0\nIn the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"""

this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \t0\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \t0\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \t0\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \t0\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \t0\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \t0\nThe flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \t0\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \t0\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \t0\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \t0\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \t1\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \t1\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \t0\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \t0\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \t0\nWoa, talk about awful.  \t0\nDo not waste your time.  \t0\nIt was just too horrible.  \t0\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \t0\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \t0\nThe poor actors.  \t0\nYou can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \t0\nIf you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  \t0\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \t0\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \t1\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \t1\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \t0\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \t0\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \t0\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \t1\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \t0\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \t0\nThe dialogue sucked.  \t0\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \t0\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \t0\nThe acting sucked.  \t0\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \t0\nThat was nice.  \t1\nThat was funny.  \t1\nIt was so funny.  \t1\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \t0\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \t0\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \t0\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \t1\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \t1\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \t1\nAnd there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \t1\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \t1\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \t1\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \t1\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \t1\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \t1\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \t1\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \t1\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \t1\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \t1\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \t1\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \t1\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \t1\nI'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \t0\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \t0\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \t1\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \t0\nAgain, lame.  \t0\nHere's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \t0\nAnd don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \t0\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \t0\nSummary: The witticisms weren't witty.  \t0\nThe plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  \t0\nThe acting was bad.  \t0\nReally bad.  \t0\nEven Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  \t0\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \t0\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \t0\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \t1\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \t1\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \t1\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \t1\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  \t1\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \t1\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \t1\nI couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \t1\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \t1\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \t1\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \t0\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  \t1\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \t1\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \t1\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \t1\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  \t1\nI'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \t0\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.  \t0\nTo those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \t0\nOne more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  \t0\nThis is such a fun and funny movie.  \t1\nHighly entertaining at all angles.  \t1\nIt features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  \t1\nSo for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  \t1\nIt even has its sweet moments.  \t1\nThe telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  \t1\nAll the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  \t1\nAnd I really did find them funny.  \t1\nThis is actually a very smart movie.  \t1\nThere is a brilliant twist ending.  \t1\n I love it.

b'<s> but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  0 it just lame  0 the guy who said he had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  0 everything about this movie is stupid  0 even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie  0 it is shameful  0 i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  1 the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show these characters were so real  1 i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  1 now you know why i gave it a 10+ 1 i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family memories  1 i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  1 the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  1 this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  1 much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  1 everything from acting to cinematography was solid  1 definitely worth checking out  1 damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  1 this movie has a cutting edge to it  1 i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  1 the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  0 i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  0 it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  0 the jerky camera movements were also annoying  0 the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  0 there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot  0 i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  0 if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  0 elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  1 this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  1 i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  0 all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  0 god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  1 the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazing stylized beautiful and effective  1 they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  1 the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  1 after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  1 i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  1 here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america own imperial age  1 what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history  1 though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery noble brigand candace bergen feisty heroine john huston wily john hay or steve kanaly spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt big stick  1 this is high adventure at its best  1 i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  1 having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  1 my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  1 almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful  0 the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  0 unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  0 non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  1 the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful  1 a good commentary of today love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  1 for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  1 it a feel good film and that how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  1 i rather enjoyed it  1 i liked it  1 i couldnt take them seriously  0 it really created a unique feeling though  1 vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  1 a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today  1 her role was played well  1 not too screamy not to masculine but just right  1 the camera really likes her in this movie  1 i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  1 as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  1 i am a fan of his   <\\s> <s> this movie sucked really bad  0 even worse than ticker 0 & that movie was bad  0 only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe & poor hummh 0 it just blew  0 this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling before i totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20 the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  1 i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorable the junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something special too funny i laughedkids will love it buy it when it comes outit has new features 1 now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  0 this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich\xc3\xa9s to be admitted elsewhere  0 almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round  0 i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  0 the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  0 oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  0 i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  0 i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  0 in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  0 it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  0 1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10  0 an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  1 the soundtrack wasnt terrible either  1 but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable  0 still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oy vey scale  1 yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  0 both do good jobs and are quite amusing  1 but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  0 i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it  0 the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  1 bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  0 the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  0 i like armand assante & my cable company summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  1 i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  1 my 8 10 score is mostly for the plot  1 i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  1 wow what a bad film  0 not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible  0 the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  0 not even good for camp value 0 i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  0 this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public  0 if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there nothing lower  0 this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  0 i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  0 victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  0 considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  0 but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s  0 the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  0 the only thing worse than taylor acting was stanwyck singing  0 whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  0 i was deeply impressed with the character he played  1 i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  1 a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich\xc3\xa9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  0 even the squibs look awful  0 at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  0 the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  0 the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  0 i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  0 the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  0 about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  0 the directing is sloppy at best  0 hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  0 of course the acting is blah  0 the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  0 and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  0 i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  1 i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  1 this movie contained an all star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before  1 this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  1 overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale  1 lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have  1 i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  0 it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  0 totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  1 this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  1 but this movie really got to me  1 see it  1 i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  1 and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv\xc3\xa5g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why  1 this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  1 i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  1 initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  1 later i found myself lost in the power of the film  1 the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  1 i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  1 duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  1 the rest of the cast also play well  1 cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  1 about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  0 about half way through this film i started to dislike it  0 by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  0 what this film lacks is a convincing script  0 the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  0 things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  0 the cast is good  1 for that it worth checking out  1 this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life  0 it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  0 everything about it is just bad  0 i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  0 the script is bad very bad \xc2\x96 it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc 17 movie  0 the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period  0 final word this show is a real torture 0 it is zillion times away from reality  0 watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show  0 rating 0 10 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  0 20th century fox road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  0 full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  0 from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  0 and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  0 whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  0 there are so many problems i dont know where to start  0 the cast was great  1 steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged upper class uptight white guy  1 add betty white and

this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking  1 while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  1 however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  1 it just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  1 clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among mickey best films even after 80 wonderful years  1 the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luv diaper commercial is

when it established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  0 director paul matthews who also wrote directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films  0 the movie is terribly boring in places  0 the lighting is awful  0 the film looks cheap and bland  0 one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  0 this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here  0 the visual effects were awful  0 the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god sake 0 the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  0 okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credit due the creature effects were actually pretty cool  1 gotta love those close ups of slimy drooling teeth 1 to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  0 not recommended  0 he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing  0 aside from it terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  0 i understand that it supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  0 lewis black considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg 13 rating certainly wont allow  0 the film sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  1 with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer  0 the budget was evidently very limited  0 this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  0 however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  0 filmiing was less expansive  0 it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  0 generally it just lacked imagination  0 not recommended  0 is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  0 even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  0 beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 i cant believe there even a sequel to this 0 which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 being a 90 child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  1 but tiny toons kept the 90 vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  1 the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  1 easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  1 the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  1 every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  1 every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  0 her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well  talk  0 perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  1 there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  0 i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie  0 what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  0 in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  0 the story line is just awful 0 it just painful 0 and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 there also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  0 dont waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film  0 i believe that pitch black was done well  1 the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it  1 go watch it 1 omit watching this  0 very funny 1 my rating just 3 out of 10  0 the characters are interesting and you really care for them  1 an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  1 dont miss it  1 this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more  1 a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  1 but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  1 it as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master work  1 the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  0 regardless the film fails on most levels  0 avoid at all costs  0 i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  1 but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  1 ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  0 he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests  0 lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  1 jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock black and white low budget original  1 nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master stable  1 i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 excellently produced by one of sci fi best producers scot vandiver 1 but it is entertaining nonetheless  1 it a campy sort of film that a joy to watch  1 there barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  1 the cast is always entertaining as usual  1 overall a delight 1 this movie is so mind bendingly awful it couldnt have even been created  0 the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  0 the least said about the acting the better  0 this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  1 i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  1 nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film  1 the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid  <\\s> <s> a must rent view or see

and evil  1 if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics  this is the one  1 this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  1 special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  1 however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb & complex  1 also notable is john bailey fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  1 even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this is baaaaaad  0 unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austen work you can skip this one  0 if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  1 it is not good  0 speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  0 then the film just dropped the ball  0 this is a stunning movie  1 raw and sublimely moving  1 it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  1 all of the main players are mesmerising  1 tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end

has so much been owed by so many to so few  <\\s>',"b"" But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \t0\nIt's just lame.  \t0\nThe guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  \t0\nEverything about this movie is stupid.  \t0\nEven if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  \t0\nIt is shameful.  \t0\nI would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  \t1\nThe writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  \t1\nI must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  \t1\nNow you know why I gave it a 10+!  \t1\nI don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  \t1\nI totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  \t1\nThe things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  \t1\nThis is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  \t1\nMuch more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  \t1\nEverything from acting to cinematography was solid.  \t1\nDefinitely worth checking out.  \t1\nDamian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  \t1\nThis movie has a cutting edge to it.  \t1\nI am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  \t1\nThe new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  \t0\nI felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  \t0\nIt didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  \t0\nThe jerky camera movements were also annoying.  \t0\nThe plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  \t0\nThere was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  \t0\nI guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  \t0\nIf you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  \t0\nElias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  \t1\nThis was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  \t1\nI really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  \t1\nThis totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  \t0\nLucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  \t0\nAll this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \t0\nGod, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  \t0\nI think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of wonder) are the excerpts from his works.  \t1\nThe sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  \t1\nThey could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  \t1\nThe stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  \t1\nAfter watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  \t1\nI highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  \t1\nHere, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  \t1\n) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  \t1\nThough The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's Big Stick.  \t1\nThis is high adventure at its best.  \t1\nI think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  \t1\nHaving to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  \t1\n(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  \t1\nAlmost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  \t0\nThe most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  \t0\nUnfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  \t0\nNon-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  \t1\nThe good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  \t1\nA good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  \t1\nFor people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  \t1\nIt was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  \t1\nIt's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  \t1\nIt has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  \t1\nI rather enjoyed it.  \t1\nI liked it.  \t1\nI couldn't take them seriously.  \t0\nIt really created a unique feeling though.  \t1\nVivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  \t1\nA world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  \t1\nHer role was played well.  \t1\nNot too screamy not to masculine but just right.  \t1\nThe camera really likes her in this movie.  \t1\nI would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  \t1\nAs a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  \t1\nI am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  \t0\nEven worse than Ticker!  \t0\n& That movie was bad.  \t0\nOnly like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  \t0\nIt just blew.  \t0\nThis movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  \t1\nI just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  \t1\nNow we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  \t0\nThis show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich\xc3\xa9s to be admitted elsewhere.  \t0\nAlmost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  \t0\nI wish I could enter negative values, admins?  \t0\nThe sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  \t0\nThe use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  \t0\nOh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  \t0\nI hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  \t0\nI am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  \t0\nIn short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  \t0\nIt came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  \t0\n1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  \t0\nAn interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  \t1\nThe soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  \t1\nBut the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  \t0\nStill, it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.  \t1\nYes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  \t0\nBoth do good jobs and are quite amusing.  \t1\nBut the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  \t0\nI let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  \t0\nThe last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \t1\nBela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  \t0\nThe acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  \t0\nI like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  \t1\nI believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  \t1\nMy 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  \t1\nI won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  \t1\nWow, what a bad film.  \t0\nNot frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  \t0\nThe plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  \t0\nNot even good for camp value!  \t0\nI wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  \t0\nYou'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  \t0\nThis film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  \t0\nIf only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  \t0\nThis gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  \t0\nThis is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  \t0\nI know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \t0\nVictor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \t0\nConsidering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \t0\nBut the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  \t0\nThe death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \t0\nThe only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  \t0\nWhatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  \t0\nI was deeply impressed with the character he played.  \t1\nI knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  \t1\nA cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich\xc3\xa9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \t0\nEven the squibs look awful.  \t0\nAt no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \t0\nThe plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \t0\nThe awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  \t0\nI was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  \t0\nThe dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \t0\nAbout 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \t0\nThe directing is sloppy at best.  \t0\nHackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \t0\nOf course, the acting is blah.  \t0\nThe acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  \t0\nAnd, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  \t0\nI loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  \t1\nI have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  \t1\nThis movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  \t1\nThis movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  \t1\nOverall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  \t1\nLifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  \t1\nI particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  \t0\nIt is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  \t0\nTotally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  \t1\nThis movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \t1\nBut this movie really got to me.  \t1\nSee it.  \t1\nI really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  \t1\nAnd I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv\xc3\xa5g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  \t1\nThis movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  \t1\nI found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  \t1\nInitially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  \t1\nLater I found myself lost in the power of the film.  \t1\nThe entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  \t1\nI left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  \t1\nDuris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  \t1\nThe rest of the cast also play well.  \t1\nCinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  \t1\nAbout ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  \t0\nAbout half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \t0\nBy the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  \t0\nWhat this film lacks is a convincing script.  \t0\nThe script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  \t0\nThings happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  \t0\nThe cast is good.  \t1\nFor that, it's worth checking out.  \t1\nThis is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  \t0\nIt is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  \t0\nEverything about it is just bad.  \t0\nI could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  \t0\nThe script is bad, very bad \xc2\x96 it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  \t0\nThe casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  \t0\nFinal Word: This Show is a real torture!!  \t0\nIt is zillion times away from reality.  \t0\nWatching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  \t0\nRating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  \t0\n20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  \t0\nFull of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \t0\nFrom here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  \t0\nHis losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \t0\nAnd if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  \t0\nWhatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  \t0\n(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  \t0\nthere are so many problems i dont know where to start.  \t0\nthe cast was great.  \t1\nsteve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  \t1\nadd betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  \t1\nbut the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  \t0\nfirst of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  \t0\nthe movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  \t0\nputting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  \t0\nthere is no real plot.  \t0\ni wouldnt see this movie again for free.  \t0\nSTEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  \t1\nThis second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \t1\nWhile you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \t1\nHowever, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \t1\nIt's just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \t1\nClever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \t1\nThe bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \t0\nI'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \t0\nThe original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  \t1\nJohn Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  \t1\nI don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  \t0\nThis may be the only bad film he ever made.  \t0\nSo bad...well...it's just bad.  \t0\nThis movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \t0\nIt's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \t0\nI thought it was bad.  \t0\nBoth films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \t0\nLet's start with all the problems\xc2\x97the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \t0\nThe script is a big flawed mess.  \t0\nThe best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  \t0\nDirector Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim, clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  \t0\nThe movie is terribly boring in places.  \t0\nThe lighting is awful.  \t0\nThe film looks cheap and bland.  \t0\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  \t0\nThis convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  \t0\nThe visual effects were AWFUL.  \t0\nThe CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  \t0\nThe explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  \t0\nOkay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  \t1\nGotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  \t1\nTo sum the film up, Breeders is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  \t0\nNot recommended.  \t0\nHe is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  \t0\nAside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \t0\nI understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  \t0\nLewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  \t0\nThe film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \t1\nWith the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \t0\nThe budget was evidently very limited.  \t0\nThis was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  \t0\nHowever, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  \t0\nFilmiing was less expansive.  \t0\nIt failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \t0\nGenerally; it just lacked imagination.  \t0\nNot recommended.  \t0\nIs it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \t0\nThere is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  \t0\nEven when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  \t0\nBeware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  \t0\nI can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  \t0\nWhich is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  \t0\nBeing a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \t1\nBut Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \t1\nThe memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \t1\nEasily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \t1\nThe characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \t1\nEvery single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \t1\nEvery element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  \t0\nHer lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \t0\nPerabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  \t1\nThere is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  \t0\nI saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \t0\nWhat is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  \t0\nTo be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  \t0\nIn conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \t0\nThe story line is just awful!  \t0\nIt's just painful!  \t0\nAnd the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \t0\nThere's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \t0\nDon't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  \t0\nI believe that Pitch Black was done well.  \t1\nThe characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  \t1\nGo watch it!  \t1\nOmit watching this.  \t0\nVERY funny!  \t1\nMy rating: just 3 out of 10.  \t0\nThe characters are interesting and you really care for them.  \t1\nAn instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \t1\nDon't miss it.  \t1\nThis is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \t1\nA mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \t1\nBut above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \t1\nIt's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \t1\nThe basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \t0\nRegardless, the film fails on most levels.  \t0\nAvoid at all costs.  \t0\nI saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \t1\nI thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \t1\nHis acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \t1\nI had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \t1\nBut it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \t1\nI'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \t1\nI know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \t0\nHe really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \t0\nLovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \t1\nJimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \t1\nNevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \t1\nI have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \t1\nExcellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  \t1\nBut it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \t1\nIt's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  \t1\nThere's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \t1\nThe cast is always entertaining as usual.  \t1\nOverall, a delight!  \t1\nThis movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \t0\nThe film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \t0\nThe least said about the acting the better.  \t0\nThis movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \t1\nI believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \t1\nNothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \t1\nThe acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \t1\nDon't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  \t1\nExcellent performance.  \t1\nThere still are good actors around!  \t1\nAlso great directing and photography.  \t1\nVery true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  \t1\nMacbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \t1\nHelen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \t1\nIf you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \t1\nThis is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \t1\nSpecial mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \t1\nHowever Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \t1\nAlso notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \t1\nEven allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \t0\nUnless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  \t0\nIf you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \t1\nIt is not good.  \t0\nSpeaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \t0\nThen the film just dropped the ball.  \t0\nThis is a stunning movie.  \t1\nRaw and sublimely moving.  \t1\nIt felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \t1\nAll of the main players are mesmerising.  \t1\nTom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \t1\nJulian Fellowes has triumphed again.  \t1\nHe's a national treasure.  \t1\nGO AND SEE IT!  \t1\nThis is an excellent film.  \t1\nThe aerial scenes were well-done.  \t1\nIt was also the right balance of war and love.  \t1\nThe film gives meaning to the phrase, Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.

affordable prices good food  1 * both the hot & sour & the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless  0 great time family dinner on a sunday night  1 the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style  0 what did bother me was the slow service  0 the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste  0 these were so good we ordered them twice  1 so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer  0 my girlfriend veal was very bad  0 unfortunately it was not good  0 i had a pretty satifying experience  1 join the club and get awesome offers via email  1 perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder  1 bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat  0 the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily  0 the nachos are a must have 1 we will not be coming back  0 i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well  1 the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff  1 great atmosphere friendly and fast service  1 when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there  1 once your food arrives it meh  0 paying $7 85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal  0 the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic  1 my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too  0 so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here

waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying  0 we wont be going back  0 the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it  0 this place lacked style 0 the sangria was about half of a

cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked  0 the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat  0 it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor  0 i was very disappointed 0 this place is horrible and way overpriced  0 maybe it just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best  0 it wasnt busy at all and now we know why  0 the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu  0 the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits  0 con spotty service  0 the fries were not hot and neither was my burger  0 but then they came back cold  0 then our food came out disappointment ensued  0 the real disappointment was our waiter  0 my husband said she was very rude  did not even apologize for the bad food or anything  0 the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach  0 insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it  0 if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door  0 after

brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh  0 food was below average  0 it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant  0 all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop  0 the problem i have is that they charge $11 99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables  0 shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 1 2 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold  0 it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry  0 it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down  0 i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage  0 the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland  0 spend your money and time some place else  0 a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad  0 the presentation of the food was awful  0 i cant tell you how disappointed i was  0 i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking  0 appetite instantly gone  0 overall i was not impressed and would not go back  0 the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time  0 then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check  0 <\\s>',"b""I'm so happy to be here!!!\t1\nTasted like dirt.\t0\nOne of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .\t1\nThe block was amazing.\t1\nIt's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.\t1\n* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!\t1\nMy sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.\t0\nGreat time - family dinner on a Sunday night.\t1\nthe food is not tasty at all, not to say its real traditional Hunan style.\t0\nWhat did bother me, was the slow service.\t0\nThe flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!\t1\nTheir frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.\t0\nThese were so good we ordered them twice.\t1\nSo in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\t0\nMy girlfriend's veal was very bad.\t0\nUnfortunately, it was not good.\t0\nI had a pretty satifying experience.\t1\nJoin the club and get awesome offers via email.\t1\nPerfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.\t1\nBland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\t0\nThe chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.\t0\nThe nachos are a MUST HAVE!\t1\nWe will not be coming back.\t0\nI don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.\t1\nThe staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.\t1\nGreat atmosphere, friendly and fast service.\t1\nWhen I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.\t1\nOnce your food arrives it's meh.\t0\nPaying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\t0\nThe classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.\t1\nMy brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.\t0\nSo good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.\t1\nThe chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.\t1\nThis place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\t1\nMediocre food.\t0\nOnce you get inside
